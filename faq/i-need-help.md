# I need help

If you have questions or need help, please do not open a GitHub issue as we use GitHub issues only to discuss about bugs and new features for the PrestaShop project.

The very best place to start looking for an answer is:

- Here (the Developer documentation), if you are a developer
- The [User's guide](https://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS17/User+Guide) if you are a user

If you are a developer and you think there is a missing item in the Developer documentation, consider [creating an issue on the Documentation Repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues). This will help us discuss what to do to improve it.

If you need help with your shop or third-party modules, please have a look at the PrestaShop Company's [support plans](https://www.prestashop.com/support).

If you have questions about a PrestaShop module or theme you have downloaded or bought on the PrestaShop Addons Marketplace, you can contact its developers through the link provided on their Marketplace page.

Finally, you can also ask for help from other PrestaShop users:

- [on the Community chat]({{< param "projectUrls.slack" >}}) (Slack)
- [on the Community forums](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/)
- [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prestashop)
